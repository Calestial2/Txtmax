- **Comments:** Yellow

## Installation and Usage

To get started with Txtmax, follow these steps:

1. **Install:** Install it by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Calestial2/Txtmax cd Txtmax cd versions gcc gcc txtmax10.c -o txtmax10 ./txtmax10
```

## OS Compatibility 

Available on Linux and Unix-like systems (macOS and BSD) üêßüêßüêß. Other OS:

- **Windows:** Run an emulator like WSL üôÉ (because dirent.h is not available by default)
- **Android:** Use Termux (works well on Termux because itself developed from Termux)

## Performance 

Extremely fast and lightweight, faster than GNU Nano and Vim because:

- C is fast in itself.
- It uses many standard libraries.
