## Txtmax Tmux Intregration 

[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Fira+Code&pause=1000&color=F70000&background=DDFF7200&width=435&lines=Txtmax+Tmux+Intregration+)](https://git.io/typing-svg)
The Txtmax Tmux Integration enables efficient multi-task management within Txtmax through seamless integration with Tmux.

**Getting Started:**
To begin using Txtmax Tmux Integration, type "multiplexer" within Txtmax.

**How It Works:**
1. **Session Initialization:**
   - Prompts the user for a session name.
   - Creates a new Tmux session with the specified name.
   - Enters an interactive loop where the user can input commands to be sent to the Tmux session.
   - After the user types "exit," they are attached to the session to view the results of the executed commands.

**Key Features:**

1. **Session Management:**
   - Creates a new detached Tmux session.
   - Validates successful session creation.
   - Handles session names cleanly.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - Provides an interactive command prompt.
   - Executes commands within the Tmux session.
   - Supports multi-word commands.
   - Includes a built-in 'exit' command to terminate input.

3. **Safety Features:**
   - Sanitizes input to prevent errors.
   - Performs error checking for system calls.
   - Prevents buffer overflow.

4. **User Experience:**
   - Offers clear prompts and status messages.
   - Ensures a 1-second delay between commands for reliability.
   - Attaches the final session for direct user interaction.

**Note:** 
Tmux must be installed on the system. Tested on Linux systems with Tmux version 3.2+.

## UI

Terminal-based, feature-rich, user-friendly, and lightweight, it presents '~/txtmax' as the command prompt, enabling users to enter commands. Upon launching, it greets with: 'Welcome to txtmax! Type 'help' for a list of available commands.
